# FriendFinder
FriendFinder - powered by node.js and express

I really enjoyed this assignment. I liked the way application is organized in different folders. I am confused at to where to put checking like finding best compatibale friend. Since I could not access friendsData from othe places, I put code under /routing/apiRoutes.js. However, I thought that contains routes only.

As I am flying to India tomorrow, I am doing minimum for this assignment. You have to enter data such as name etc. and your response with radio buttons. 

I have created good test data. If you Strongly Disagree on all 10 questions, Lisa would be your friend and if you Strongly Agree on all 10 questions, Nancy would be your best friend.

I hope I will get chance to redo this assignment if I got anything wrong. I will be back on Feb 22 which is 2 days after this is due on Feb 20. I have to catch up on other assignment which is due on Feb 27.

Thanks
